# go-ai-self-plays
Collection of Go game records of AI long self-plays. 

Self-plays used for training have a relatively low visit count. In contrast, the game records here have long thinking time, so they are closer to the networks' theoretical top performance. Producing these long games are still computation intensive, so it may be useful to share them.
